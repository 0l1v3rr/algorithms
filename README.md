# Data Structures and Algorithms
My implementation of different Data Structures, Algorithms and simple coding challenges.

## Algorithms

- [Bubble Sort](https://github.com/0l1v3rr/algorithms/blob/master/src/main/java/com/oliverr/algorithms/sorting/BubbleSort.java)
  - This sorting algorithm repeatedly steps through the array, compares the elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This is repeated until the array is sorted.
  - **O(n^2)**
- [Insertion Sort](https://github.com/0l1v3rr/algorithms/blob/master/src/main/java/com/oliverr/algorithms/sorting/InsertionSort.java)
  - Insertion sort iterates, consuming one input element each repetition, and grows a sorted output list. At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list, and inserts it there. It repeats until no input elements remain.
  - **O(n^2)**
- [Selection Sort](https://github.com/0l1v3rr/algorithms/blob/master/src/main/java/com/oliverr/algorithms/sorting/SelectionSort.java)
  - The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.
  - **O(n^2)**
- [Merge Sort](https://github.com/0l1v3rr/algorithms/blob/master/src/main/java/com/oliverr/algorithms/sorting/MergeSort.java)
  - Merge sort divides input array into two halves, recursively calls itself for the two halves, and merges the two sorted halves.
  - **O(n*log(n))**
- [Quick Sort](https://github.com/0l1v3rr/algorithms/blob/master/src/main/java/com/oliverr/algorithms/sorting/QuickSort.java)
  - This algorithm selects a pivot element into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.
  - **O(n*log(n))**
